# Food pairing with Different Meads
Pairing food with mead can elevate both the drink and the meal to a whole new level of gastronomic delight. Given the diversity in mead's classifications, each type brings its own unique pairing possibilities. Here are some food pairing recommendations for various classifications of mead:

* **Dry Traditional Mead:** This mead is versatile due to its balance of sweetness and dryness. It pairs well with smokey foods such as smoked salmon, fatty cheeses, sausage, and smoked almonds. Its clean finish also complements spicy dishes, allowing the flavors to shine without overwhelming the palate.
* **Sweet Meads:** With their pronounced sweetness, sweet meads can accompany dessert courses like peaches and cream or shortcake with strawberries. They also balance out the spiciness in dishes, making them a good match for spicy vegetable and meat dishes, similar to how Ethiopian tej is served.
* **Melomel:** Fruit-forward melomels pair beautifully with dark, heavy meals like steaks, stews, chili, and even desserts that echo the fruit used in the mead. For example, a berry melomel might go well with a berry tart or cheesecake.
* **Metheglin:** The spices in metheglin make it a great companion to hearty, savory dishes such as roast meats (pork, lamb, veal, or venison) and rich stews. The spices can also complement the flavors in Indian or Middle Eastern cuisine.
* **Cyser:** Cyser's apple notes mean it pairs well with autumnal dishes, pork, and poultry. A buttery, herby roast chicken or a pork dish with an apple compote would be ideal.
* **Pyment:** Pyment bridges the gap between mead and wine, making it suitable for meals typically paired with wines, such as pasta dishes, red meats, and cheese platters.
* **Braggot:** Braggot's beer-like qualities make it a good match for pub fare, including burgers, fish and chips, and salty snacks like pretzels.
* **Session Mead:** Lighter and less alcoholic, session meads are perfect for casual sipping alongside light appetizers, salads, or as an accompaniment to brunch dishes.
* **Sparkling Mead:** The effervescence of sparkling mead makes it a festive choice for celebrations. Pair it with stronger fish (salmon, tuna, seabass), shellfish (scampi, prawns, squid), or poultry like goose and duck to cut through the richness of these dishes.
