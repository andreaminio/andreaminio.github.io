# Honey

## Literature on different kinds of honey in mead
### Good
- **Alfalfa (erba medica, _Medicago sativa_)** 
    - high dextrose, low ash, low nitrogen.

- **Blackberry**:
    - High pH (5.0), high Maltose (11.3%), high ash, high nitrogen.

- **Blueberry**
    - like a light version of orange blossom
    - High Maltose, low acid, higher pH, high nitrogen.

- **Buckwheat**
    - watch the type though. Taste it first before buying a lot as some strains are musty and odd.

- **Carrot blossom**
    - neat and earthy.

- **Cherry or apple blossom**
    - like drinking in the aroma of spring.
       
* **Chestnut**
    * *love it or hate it*
    * Gives the mead a really deep beautiful color and some much appreciated tannins
    * The chestnut honey gives a lot of bochet-like flavours without any kind of heavily caramelized sugar.
    * Intense dry flavour with strong accents of malt
    * It is smooth and sweet (but dry according to my hydrometer), a fantastic mouthfeel, the oak gave some vanilla flavours I really dig.
    * There is a bit of acidity as you would expect from a dry mead but it is unidimensional.

- **Chicory**
    - mentholly an refreshing in a good way. Perfect palate cleanser between courses.

- **Christmas Berry Honey**
    - Flavor profile and characteristics
        - Harvested from Hawaiian Christmas Berry (Wilelaiki) blossoms, this honey is bright golden yellow and slower to crystallize. Christmas Berry Honey has a nice fruit flavor and an herbal, slightly spiced aftertaste. Some have described it as having a butterscotch-like flavor.
    - Tips for using Christmas Berry Honey for Mead Making:
        - This honey’s unique sweet & confectionary tasting notes makes it perfect for a batch of holiday mead or spiced mead! Consider adding mulling spices or caramelizing the honey before fermentation to make a “bochet” (carmelized honey mead).

* **Citrus**
    * By analysis of the numbers, citrus honey appears to be an excellent candidate for brewing. While the dextrose level is a bit high, moisture is low, pH is in the middle, and ash content is very low. The low nitrogen content might dictate higher than normal yeast nutrient use. Citrus honey of any blend is marketed as "Orange Blossom," and is light in flavor and very aromatic. Micah Millspaw has made some excellent mead from orange blossom honey.

- **Meadowfoam** 
    - can you say toasted marshmallow?

- **Orange blossom** 
    - perfect balance of flavour and acidity straight up. This is the one I recommend people start with.
    - Flavor profile and characteristics:
        - Orange blossom honey offers a distinct citrus aroma with sweet, floral undertones. Zesty, juicy and floral character shines through in the finished mead, especially when Orange Blossom Honey is used for backsweetening.
    - Tips for using Orange Blossom Honey for Mead Making:
        - Orange Blossom Honey is perfect for making refreshing, aromatic meads, especially when aiming for lighter, fruit-forward beverages.
        - This honey style is excellent for making melomels (fruited meads), because the citrusy character adds even more fruit character.

- **Poison oak or ivy**
    - buttery an awesome. No you won't react to it.

- **Pumpkin blossom -** 
    - all day every day. Oh so good and rich. Oh wait nvm this is horrible honey never buy this just let me know where you find it so I can umm destroy all the stock.

- **Snowberry**
    - neat residual acidity a great mead to age.

- **Tupelo** 
    - buttery rich and oh so pricey but worth every cent.
    - White tupelo is the primary source for the light unblended honey sold as tupelo honey. It has a very high levulose content, low dextrose and high maltose count, which make it attractive to brewers. Low ash, high Acids and moderate pH

- Fireweed - awesome stuff. Very floral
    - [Epilobium angustifolium - Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilobium_angustifolium)
    - Other than slightly lower than normal total acids and ash, fireweed honey looks like a very average honey. Fireweed honey did not express a dramatic nose or flavor, and doesn't seem to create much of a stir as a mead.





- Heather - another way too pricey but awesome one. Very floral and rich.





* Mango Blossom Honey
    * Flavor profile and characteristics:
        - Mango blossom honey features a tropical, fruity profile with a smooth, mellow sweetness.
        - Because it’s harvested from the nectar of blooming mango trees, this honey possesses tropical fruit and floral notes.
    - Tips for using Mango Blossom Honey for Mead Making:
        - This honey is excellent for crafting exotic, tropical-inspired meads, often enjoyed semi-sweet or sweet.
        - Try making a mango melomel (fruited mead), with diced mango chunks!

* Hawaiian Flower Honey
    * Flavor profile and characteristics:
        - Hawaiian wildflower honey, sourced from diverse flowers across Hawaii, offers a complex, exotic flavor profile. It often includes notes of tropical fruit, hibiscus, plumeria and even subtle earthiness, perfect for creating unique, aromatic meads.
    * Tips for using Hawaiian Wildflower Honey for Mead Making:
        - Take inspiration from the source and make a Hawaiian mead with hibiscus flowers, tropical fruit or even ginger.

- Japanese Bamboo: 
    - High Maltose, higher pH, low to medium ash, high nitrogen.



- Chinquapin: 
    - Low moisture, low dextrose, high maltose, very high other sugars, very high ash (.761%).

- Gallberry: 
    - Low acid, higher pH (4.2).

- Black Locust: 
    - High maltose, very low acid (15.54), very low ash (.052%), low nitrogen.

- Peppermint: 
    - High pH (4.7), high acid, very high ash (.473)

- Prune: 
    - High moisture, high maltose, pH 6.0!, acids very low (11.80), ash .694%

- Vetch, hairy: 
    - Average sugar values, low pH, low total acids, very low ash, low nitrogen.

* _Clover_: 
    * The values shown here are for sweet clover honey, and the U.S.D.A. has several dozen specimens profiled in their bulletin. Moisture levels tend to run on the high side, making clover honey a candidate for quick use. As with most of the lighter flavored honeys, ash content is low, as is total acid content, which would contribute to a softer flavor profile. It looks like a great case honey for flavored meads.

* _Mesquite_: 
    * High pH is due to lack of total acid, not high ash buffering. This honey should ferment well with a healthy dose of nitrogen and no pH adjustment. Low moisture and acid content make for higher sugar content by weight. Low ash should mean light color and minimal offensive odor or flavor. Might require some acid before bottling for balance, especially in sweeter meads.

* _Sage_: 
    * Another low ash, middle-of-the-road sugar blend honey. Known to be light in flavor with a delicate and inviting aroma. One to be explored.

* _Tulip Poplar_: 
    * Tulip Poplar honey is a very distinctive honey in aroma, and although one of the darker honeys, has a mild and appealing flavor. Tulip poplar honey has a high maltose content, lending to its complexity, and, like other dark honeys, is high in ash content. Tulip poplar honey is widely available from the north to the south throughout the midwest.

### Variable or bland
- Wildflower - results may vary
    - The range of honeys sold as "Wildflower" is too great to he characterized by one broad brush statement. The U.S.D.A. included 57 "blend of floral source" honeys in its study, with pH values from 3.67 to 5.30, ash contents from .054 to .615, and other swings in other categories. Our experience with the wildflower honey in our batch was not particularly favorable, and I suspect too much mineral content, but some of the honeys had values which looked very conducive to good mead. Caveat Emptor.
* _Commercially Blended Honey_: 
    * The drawback to much commercially blended honey is that it has been heat pasteurized, albeit at temps in the 145 F range. 
    * The upside is that the honey is generally buffered through blending to a pH around 3.9, is light amber in color and therefore free of excessive mineral content, and has been blended to have a neutral palate and nose. 
    * It makes a good base honey, frequently providing quality grading which assures low moisture content, and color grading for ease of use and good record keeping.
- Acacia - another way too light and not much left after ferment.


### Maybe
- Sourwood - funky and surprisingly sour
    - dextrose low, maltose very high, pH 4.53, acids 16.95, ash slightly high. Very interesting candidate. Highly respected among honey authorities.
- Raspberry - too mild straight needs fruit or spice
    - Very high ash content may make this honey somewhat suspect, although it expresses a dynamite nose and flavor out of the jar. Very interesting sugar blend should create complexity, and high nitrogen should benefit fermentation.
- Maple - very astringent and odd

### Suggested not to use
- Rhododendron - it's poisonous.
- Beechwood - like blue cheese mixed in honey
- Basswood - it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- Pine - it's cat-tastic. Although I recently found a commercial mead made from it so I will revisit and possibly change my opinion.
- Eucalyptus

## Notes
### VARIATION OF COMPOSITION BY FLORAL VARIETY

The variable composition factors which affect honey and fermentation are: Moisture content (lower moisture means higher percentage of sugar content), Percent dextrose (lower dextrose means lower crystallization), Complexity of sugar blend (higher concentrations of maltose and other sugars make for more complex flavor and aroma variations. This usually also corresponds to lower dextrose levels), pH (affects fermentation and flavor profile), Total Acid content (flavor), Ash (mineral content – affects aroma, flavor and fermentation) and nitrogen content (fermentation). This data is presented on Table 1.

Total acids are expressed as millequivalent/kilogram; it reflects amount of cationic charge produced by the acids in the solution. The average for the 490 samples was 29.12; we have weighted our assessment of each honey's acidity against that value.
